/* Platform-specific fixes */

/* This file previously contained CSS to hide scanner-related UI on iOS/mobile devices.
   Now that we've implemented proper component separation with:
   - IOSFileUploadSection.tsx (for iOS)
   - FileUploadSection.tsx (for desktop)
   
   Most of those CSS rules are no longer needed. We're handling platform differences
   directly in the component structure rather than through CSS.
*/

/* We'll keep this file as a placeholder for future platform-specific CSS fixes that
   can't be handled through component separation. */
