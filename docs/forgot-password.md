# Forgot Password Feature

## Purpose

The Forgot Password feature allows users to reset their password when they've forgotten it. This is a critical security feature that:

1. Provides a self-service mechanism for users to regain access to their accounts
2. Maintains security by verifying user identity through email
3. Improves overall user experience by reducing support tickets for password resets

## Implementation Details

### Supabase API Used

The implementation leverages Supabase's built-in Authentication API, specifically:

```typescript
const { error } = await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, {
  redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/reset-password`
});
```

This method:
- Sends a password reset email to the user's registered email address
- Includes a secure token-based link that expires after a set period
- Redirects users back to our application's reset password page after clicking the link

### Component and Hook Breakdown

#### 1. `useForgotPassword.ts` Hook

A custom React hook that encapsulates the password reset logic:

- **State Management**: Tracks loading state, errors, and success status
- **API Integration**: Calls Supabase's `resetPasswordForEmail` method
- **Error Handling**: Properly handles and formats errors from the API
- **Logging**: Logs important events for debugging and monitoring

#### 2. `ForgotPassword.tsx` Component

A dedicated page for the password reset flow:

- **User Interface**: Provides a clean form with email input
- **Validation**: Uses Zod schema for email validation
- **Feedback**: Shows appropriate loading states and success/error messages
- **Navigation**: Includes links back to the login page

#### 3. AuthForm.tsx Integration

The existing login form has been modified to include:

- A "Forgot password?" link positioned next to the Password label
- Proper styling consistent with the application design
- Navigation to the dedicated forgot password page

## Security Considerations

1. **Email Enumeration Prevention**: 
   - The API always returns a successful response regardless of whether the email exists
   - This prevents malicious actors from determining which email addresses are registered

2. **Token Security**:
   - Supabase generates secure, time-limited tokens
   - Tokens are single-use and invalidated after password reset

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Backend should implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (currently handled by Supabase)

4. **Email Safety**:
   - No sensitive information is included in the reset email besides the reset link

## Future Enhancements

### Custom Email Templates via Postmark

TODO: Implement custom email templates for password reset using:
- Supabase Email Template customization
- Postmark integration for improved deliverability and design

### In-App Password Reset

âœ… Implemented in-app password reset flow with:
- `ResetPassword.tsx` component that handles the complete password reset flow
- Form validation for password complexity requirements including:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter 
  - At least one number
- Success messaging with automatic redirection to login page after 3 seconds
- Error handling for invalid or expired reset links

### Additional Security Features

#### Implemented Security Features
- **Cross-tab authentication prevention**: Prevents unintended authentication in other open tabs when a user clicks a password reset link, maintaining proper session isolation
- Password validation requiring:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number

#### Future Considerations
- Multi-factor authentication option during password reset for high-security accounts
- Account activity notifications when password is reset
- Password strength meter during password reset

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Flow Testing**:
   - Submit a valid email address of a registered user
   - Verify receipt of password reset email
   - Click link in email and ensure correct redirection

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Test with invalid email format
   - Test with empty submission
   - Verify appropriate error messages

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Verify that response doesn't indicate whether email exists
   - Check expiration of reset token
   - Verify token is invalidated after use
