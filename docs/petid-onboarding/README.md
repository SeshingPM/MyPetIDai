# MyPetID Multi-Step Onboarding Flow Implementation Plan

This document provides an overview of the implementation plan for the MyPetID multi-step onboarding flow. The plan is divided into multiple documents that cover different aspects of the implementation.

## Overview

The MyPetID multi-step onboarding flow is designed to capture detailed pet and owner data, store it in a scalable and ML-ready structure, and generate a globally unique Pet ID for each pet in the format DM-20-0420 (where D/C represents pet type, M/F represents gender, 20 represents the last two digits of birth/adoption year, and 0420 is a random 4-digit number).

The flow consists of four progressive pages with a progress bar:

1. **Pet Info**: Name, type, breed, birth/adoption date, gender
2. **Owner Info**: Full name, zip, phone (with optional SMS opt-in)
3. **Pet Lifestyle**: Food type, treats, insurance, medications/supplements
4. **Account Creation**: Email and password for signup

After the user completes the flow, a unique Pet ID is generated and the user is redirected to the dashboard.

## Implementation Plan Documents

The implementation plan is divided into the following documents:

1. [**Database Schema Changes**](plan1.md): Outlines the required database schema changes, including modifications to existing tables and creation of new tables.

2. [**Frontend Components (Part 1)**](plan2.md): Covers the main container component, state management, and the first two steps of the onboarding process (Pet Info and Owner Info).

3. [**Frontend Components (Part 2)**](plan3.md): Covers the remaining steps of the onboarding process (Pet Lifestyle and Account Creation), as well as integration with the router, styling, and accessibility considerations.

4. [**Backend Implementation**](plan4.md): Details the backend data flow, API implementation, Pet ID generation, data validation, error handling, and integration with the frontend.

5. [**Testing and Deployment**](plan5.md): Outlines the testing strategy, deployment plan, monitoring and analytics, and the beginning of future enhancements.

6. [**Future Enhancements and Maintenance**](plan6.md): Completes the future enhancements section and adds maintenance considerations for the onboarding flow.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Step Form**: Progressive disclosure of form fields to reduce cognitive load
- **Data Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation to ensure data integrity
- **Unique Pet ID Generation**: Algorithm to generate globally unique Pet IDs
- **Conditional Dropdowns**: Breed, medication, and supplement options that change based on animal type (dog vs cat)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach to ensure usability on all devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG-compliant implementation for all users
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Analytics**: Tracking of user interactions for future improvements

## Implementation Timeline

The implementation is planned to be completed in the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Database Setup** (Days 1-2)
   - Create/modify migration files
   - Test migrations in development environment
   - Verify data integrity and constraints

2. **Phase 2: Frontend Components** (Days 3-7)
   - Create multi-step form components
   - Implement state management
   - Design UI with progress indicators
   - Add validation

3. **Phase 3: Backend Implementation** (Days 8-10)
   - Implement Pet ID generation
   - Create API endpoints
   - Set up data validation
   - Implement error handling

4. **Phase 4: Integration and Testing** (Days 11-14)
   - Connect frontend and backend
   - Test the complete flow
   - Verify data integrity
   - Test Pet ID uniqueness

5. **Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring** (Day 15)
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues
   - Gather user feedback

## Getting Started

To implement this plan, follow these steps:

1. Review the database schema changes in [plan1.md](plan1.md)
2. Create the frontend components as outlined in [plan2.md](plan2.md) and [plan3.md](plan3.md)
3. Implement the backend functionality as described in [plan4.md](plan4.md)
4. Set up testing and deployment as outlined in [plan5.md](plan5.md)
5. Consider future enhancements and maintenance as described in [plan6.md](plan6.md)

## Dependencies

The implementation relies on the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form, Zod
- **Backend**: Supabase, PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Supabase

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a multi-step onboarding flow for MyPetID. By following this plan, you'll be able to create a user-friendly, accessible, and scalable onboarding experience that captures all the necessary data for the platform.
